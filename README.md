# 📌 Lane Detection and Steering Angle Estimation

**Lane Detection and Steering Angle Estimation** is a vision-based perception and control system that detects lane regions and estimates the steering angle using deep learning and filtering techniques. The project integrates semantic segmentation, geometric curve fitting, and Kalman filtering into a complete pipeline designed for autonomous driving applications. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 Project Summary

Lane detection and steering estimation are fundamental tasks in autonomous driving and driver-assistance systems. Traditional methods based on classical computer vision struggle with lighting changes, shadows, and road texture variations. This project combines a **U-Net deep learning model** with signal smoothing using a **Kalman Filter** to produce robust lane segmentation and smooth steering angle estimation. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🎯 Objectives

This project aims to:

- Perform **semantic segmentation for lane detection** using a U-Net CNN model. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Extract lane boundaries from predicted segmentation masks. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- Estimate steering angles from lane geometry (curve fitting). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- Apply a **Kalman Filter** to smooth steering estimates. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Demonstrate an end-to-end perception → estimation pipeline for autonomous navigation. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

📊 Dataset Description

- The dataset contains image–mask pairs where:

  - Image: Front-facing RGB road image frame.

  - Mask: Binary segmentation mask labelling the lane region (white for lane area, black for background).

- Preprocessing includes:

  - Resizing to standard input size.

  - Normalizing pixel values.

  - Converting masks to binary.

🧠 U-Net Model Details

- Architecture: Modified U-Net for binary segmentation.

- Activation: Sigmoid.

- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy.

- Optimizer: Adam.

- Trained from scratch on custom lane dataset.

📈 Steering Angle Estimation

- After segmentation, lane boundaries are extracted and approximated with a 2nd-order polynomial curve. The tangent of this curve is used to compute a steering angle. Noise and frame-to-frame variation are minimized using a Kalman Filter, resulting in a smoother steering output.

⚠️ Limitations

- Binary segmentation does not distinguish between left/right lanes.

- Reflection, shadows, and wet surfaces can still reduce performance.

- Real-time optimization and hardware integration are future goals.
